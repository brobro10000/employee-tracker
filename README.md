## **The mySQL based Employee Database**
This program allows you to keep track of your employees in your business using an SQL database. Using MySQL to organize the database, we can access informationa about or organization and its employees.

- When the user navigates to the root folder, they simply type 'npm start' to initialize the database. On initialization they are presented with a series of options to view and manipulate the data in the database.

# Why it Matters?
Learning and using SQL is an efficient way to store, sort, filter and manipulate large quantities of data and present them in a efficient manner in a program or for yourself. CRUD or Create, Read, Update and Delete are the basic functions of persistent storage. Learning SQL and using it is vital for creating programs that utilize CRUD for a better user experience for those using the application, and the developer maintaining large amounts of data.
